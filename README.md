# Creative-Coding-Portfolio
Creative Coding Portfolio using p5.js
by Bithiah A. Monte

In this repository, I have recorded some creative coding experiments that were created with the use of the p5.js library. I have used the portfolio to examine some of the basic concepts of creative coding such as the use of variables, repetition, interaction, randomness, and time based animation.

The experiments will be presented in the form of individual sketches. Each sketch will be accompanied with commentary. Live versions of the sketches will be hosted through GitHub Pages. This will enable interactive engagement with the experiments. Additionally, a showcase project has been included in the portfolio. This project remixes an existing p5.js tutorial.

## Technologies Used
- p5.js
- JavaScript
- HTML
- GitHub & GitHub Pages

## Experiments

1. [Shapes with Variables](./shapes-with-variables/)
2. [Repetition with Loops](./repetition-with-loops/)
3. [Interaction with Mouse or Keyboard](./interaction/)
4. [Randomness Experiment](./randomness/)
5. [Time-Based Animation](./time-animation/)
6. [Remix a Tutorial (Showcase Piece)](./remix-tutorial/)

Each folder contains the source code, a live sketch link, screenshots, and a written reflection describing the creative and technical decisions behind the work.
