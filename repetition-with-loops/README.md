## Description and Reflection

The sketch uses a for loop to draw a repeating pattern of shapes across the canvas. Each shape is evenly spaced using calculated values rather than hard-coded positions, allowing the pattern to scale and remain consistent regardless of canvas size. I experimented with the number of the repeated shapes and the spacing between them to explore how reptition can create rhythm and balance in visual generation. By adjusting the loop, like the number of iterations, I was able to create different outcomes while keeping the same structure.

Problems I went through was at first some shapes were positioned too close together or went beyond the canvas. I fixed this by basing off of the canvas' width and height, ensuring that each shape was placed at consistent gaps.
