## Reflection (Tutorial Remix)

A remix of basic p5.js tutorial found on the Coding Train, which involves basic shape drawing and animation.

One thing that I changed in my version is, as I changed the style/behavior of the sketch from static to dynamic. First, I changed the palette and positioning of the sketch to make it more expressive. Then, I incorporated interaction through modifying how shapes react to time as well as user interaction.

In modifying the original code I was also able to investigate my own personal style while remaining in the technical infrastructure created in the original tutorial. In doing this, my understanding of pre-existing code as a means in which original work is created and not necessarily followed outright increased.
